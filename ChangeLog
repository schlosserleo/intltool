	wants to use us :)

	2.50.

2001-05-30  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

	causing problems with Tinderbox.

2001-05-09  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* Makefile.am: SUBDIRS included "." for a good reason. That's
	the only way to make sure the scripts are built before the
	tests directory. The problem was actually a bug in automake
	1.3 -- this program requires automake 1.4.

2001-05-09  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Rolled all the changes from the stable branch to here. We're
	going to stop using the stable branch and just develop on HEAD.

	2001-05-09  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	Fix bug 8274 (autogen.sh creates recursive makefile on Solaris):

	* Makefile.am: For some reason, SUBDIRS included "." -- no wonder
	the makefile went on forever!

	2001-05-08  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* tests/cases/.cvsignore: Ignore a generated file.

	2001-05-08  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* tests/results/Makefile.am:
	Added George's tests to the EXTRA_DIST so that "make distcheck"
	passes.

	2001-05-02  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* xml-i18n-po-Makefile.in.in-patch-2: New version of the gettext
	0.10.36 (and newer) patch contributed by Stanislav Brabec
	<utx@penguin.cz>.

	2001-04-27  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	A first try at making xml-i18n-tools compatible with the new
	gettext 0.10.36. I created a new patch and make the toolize
	script choose the appropriate patch based on the file contents.

	* xml-i18n-tools.Makefile.patch:
	* xml-i18n-po-Makefile.in.in-patch-1:
	Renamed the old patch.

	* xml-i18n-po-Makefile.in.in-patch-2:
	Checked in a new patch that works with gettext 0.10.36.

	* xml-i18n-toolize.in:
	Added code to use patch2 if "builddir" appears in the file
	and patch1 if it doesn't.

	* Makefile.am:
	Add the new files.

2001-03-25  George Lebl <jirka@5z.com>

	* xml-i18n-extract.in.in (type_xml): The message is anything but <,

	* xml-i18n-merge.in.in (xml_merge_translations)
	  (oaf_merge_translations):  Rename the old xml mode to "oaf" mode
	  as Maciej requested.  For XML files merge the pong style

	modules when xml-i18n-toolizing.
	* xml-i18n-toolize.in: copy .in versions of tools into module.
	* xml-i18n-tools.Makefile.patch: don't change DISTFILES, this

	fix the stuff I broke with the last change.
	* tests/results/merge1.xml: Got rid of extra space in test
	case that corresponded to an extra space made by the script.

2001-01-31  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* tests/selftest.pl: Use the "srcdir" environment variable

	gettext/ini means that it should use the

	Fix bug 5454 (Translators have to run ./autogen.sh in each module
	they work on).

	* Makefile.am: Install xml-i18n-update and xml-i18n-extract, so

	by doing `xml-i18n-update <lang>' with the xml-i18n-tools package
	installed.
	
	* xml-i18n-update.in: Translators have to run ./autogen.sh in each
	module they work on. Find installed xml-i18n-extract as well as
	the one in the source tree, for purposes of running on
	non-autogen'd modules.

2001-01-08  Maciej Stachowiak  <mjs@eazel.com>

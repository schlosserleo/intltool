0.8.4:

The GNOME community is proud to announce a new release of xml-i18n-tools
(codename "Så skeet de ilywl - de havde a slet  ett regnet mæ"), that 
includes more fixes and less bugs than ever before.

The release can until it's up on ftp.gnome.org be fetched from the 
following location: 

	http://www.sslug.dk/locale/xml-i18n-tools-0.8.3.tar.gz

* New in this release:

 - Support for the new gettext 0.10.36 (Darin, Stanislav Brabec)

 - Better XML support (George)

 - More tests (Darin)

 - Handling of more extentions (Clahey, Laszlo, me) 

 - Spec file cleanup (Arik)

 - Updated documentation (Laszlo)

 - Misc bugfixes (Darin, Maciej, Laszlo, me)

 - New translations: hrm, this is a translation tool, why should it 
   support translation - what a concept :)

If I am missing something here, I am sorry. Write me and I will announce 
it in next release.

Cheers, Kenneth
on behalf of the xml-i18n-tools team
